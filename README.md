QSTM - Qt SSH/Serial Connections Tab Manager

Basically just a silly little tool to manage multiple remote sessions.
Supports tabs, basic password manager (password are stored in plaintext), serial connections, copy and paste, and session logging.
Has white and dark themes (white is buggy, don't use it).
That is literally all it does!
